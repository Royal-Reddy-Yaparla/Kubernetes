## namespace

<img src="./images/namespace.webp" alt="Getting started" />

In Kubernetes, a namespace is a logical partition within a Kubernetes cluster that is used to divide resources and isolate them from one another.

Namespaces are a key organizational tool that helps manage resources effectively in large-scale Kubernetes deployments by

## Isolated Environment:

Each namespace provides an isolated space within the same Kubernetes cluster. Resources in one namespace donâ€™t interfere with those in another.

``Example``: Teams or applications can work independently within their own namespaces.

## Partitioning Based on Teams or Environments:

Namespaces can be used to logically separate:
Different teams: team-A, team-B, etc.
Different environments: dev, test, prod.

## Compute Resource Management:

Namespaces allow you to set resource quotas (CPU, memory, etc.) so that each partition gets only the required resources and prevents one namespace from over-consuming cluster resources.

## Access Control (RBAC):

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) can be configured to grant permissions for users or services to interact only with specific namespaces.

``Example``: Developers in team-A can only access team-A-namespace and cannot interact with resources in team-B-namespace.
