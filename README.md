### Why Kubernetes

---

### Challenges in VM Deployments:
- **Responsibility Overhead**: Managing infrastructure, scaling, updates, and monitoring is entirely manual.
- **Scaling**:
  - Requires configuration of **launch templates**, **AMIs**, **target groups**, and **load balancers**.
- **Disadvantages**:
  1. **Traffic Management**: Inefficient handling of sudden spikes or drops in traffic.
  2. **Self-Healing**: Manual intervention is needed to recover from failures.
  3. **Load Balancing**: Static and lacks automated scaling mechanisms.

---

### Challenges with Docker (Standalone):
1. **Single Docker Host Dependency**:
   - If the Docker host crashes, all containers are lost, including data (even with Docker volumes).
2. **Scalability**:
   - No automated scaling for containers when traffic increases or decreases.
3. **Load Balancing**:
   - No built-in mechanism to distribute traffic among containers.
4. **Resilience**:
   - If a container crashes, Docker alone cannot restart it automatically.
5. **Configuration and Secrets Management**:
   - No native, secure, centralized way to handle configurations and secrets.
6. **Multi-Host Management**:
   - Managing containers across multiple hosts is complex and lacks coordination.

### Solution: Container Orchestration
To overcome the above disadvantages, **container orchestration** is necessary. Popular tools include:
- **Kubernetes**: Industry standard for large-scale container orchestration.
- **Docker Swarm**: Lightweight orchestration built into Docker.

Kubernetes solves these issues by providing:
- **Automated Scaling**: Pods scale based on traffic and resource usage.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically restarts failed pods.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across healthy pods.
- **Centralized Configuration Management**: Handles secrets and configs securely.
- **Multi-Host Management**: Manages containers across multiple nodes seamlessly.
